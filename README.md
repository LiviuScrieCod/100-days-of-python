# 🐍 100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp

Not just a simple Python course, but having fun while learning and also turning it into a hub of 100 challenges turned portfolio.

### 🛠 Technologies used:
* PyScript - the heart of the project. Manages DOM and creates page elements. I chose it because I want more Python in my Python project!
* Python - I mean... it's a Python project.
* Vanilla CSS - keeping things simple in terms of UI/UX
* HTML5 - well... that's a given I guess

### 💡 The vision
The whole UI is basically fueled by a Python dictionary. I didn't want to waste time copy-pasting HTML all over the place (plus, imagine the horror of changing anything). It's cleaner, faster, easier to edit and allows me to focus on actual learning and coding.

## 📝 Day-by-day ***"happenings"***!

### Day 1: Planning & Pyscript integration
* Built the backbone of the hub
* Wrestled pyscript.json to get things displayed using localhost
* Managed to get 100 elements rendered on the page, proper info displayed
